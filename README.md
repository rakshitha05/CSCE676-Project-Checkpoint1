##  Project Overview

This project analyzes a real world social network graph using classical data mining
and modern representation learning techniques. The goal is to explore structural
properties of graph data, identify meaningful patterns, and evaluate how embeddings
capture network behavior.

The selected dataset is the **SNAP Facebook Combined Graph**, a widely used benchmark
dataset for graph mining research.


##  Dataset

**Source:** Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP)  
**Dataset:** Facebook Combined Graph  

- Nodes: 4039  
- Edges: 88,234  
- Graph Type: Undirected  
- Node Attributes: None (structural analysis)

##  Objectives

This checkpoint focuses on:

✔ Dataset selection and justification  
✔ Data cleaning and preprocessing  
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✔ Bias and ethical considerations  
✔ Foundation for advanced techniques


##  Techniques Applied

### **Course-Aligned Methods**

- Graph Construction & Cleaning
- Graph Summary Statistics
- Degree Distribution Analysis
- Centrality Measures
- Community Detection

### **Beyond-Core Exploration**

- Spectral Graph Embeddings
- PCA Visualization of Embeddings


##  Data Cleaning Decisions

The following preprocessing steps were applied:

- Removed self-loops
- Removed duplicate edges
- Canonicalized undirected edges
- Loaded node IDs as strings

**Why this matters:**  
Graph metrics are sensitive to structural artifacts. Cleaning ensures correctness
and prevents distortion of degree and centrality measures.


##  Key Findings

- The network is sparse but fully connected
- Degree distribution is highly skewed
- Hub nodes dominate centrality rankings
- Community sizes are uneven
- Embeddings capture structural variation


##  Bias & Limitations

This dataset reflects sampling decisions during collection. Structural conclusions
may not generalize to all social networks. Absence of node attributes limits semantic
interpretation.


##  Future Directions

Potential extensions include:

- Similarity search via LSH
- Link prediction experiments
- Node classification (if attributes available)
- Graph neural network methods
